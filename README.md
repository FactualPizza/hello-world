Hi there,
My name is Rens, I am Dutch.
I want to learn how to code. I'm a molecular biologist and have no degree in coding but I see parallels between the mechanisms in human cells (RNA and DNA) and computer coding. 
I've started with c++ and follow Chili's video's. It's not easy but I don't want to give up. So I take it step by step.
Wish me good luck!
